# mobile-ad-hoc-network-simulation-using-ns-3

Using NS-3 to compare the performance of mobile ad-hoc network routing protocols such as AODV, DSR and DSDV.

Comparison of the three protocols is done with the following aspects in mind: 

1] Delay caused by routing protocols
2] The number of mobile nodes
3] Distance between nodes
4] Speed [Pause Time]
